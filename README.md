# A React based Todo-List Application to learn the basics of React.js Library.
I have created this react-app by referring to a Youtube Channel Code With Harry.

# Getting started with the project :

- First you need to create a new react app using command $create-react-app
- Enter into the app repo and run $npm start or $yarn start
- To create the app from the scratch you only need a index.hhtml file in public folder and index.css, index.js, app.js files in the src folder
- You need to add components file to the src folder and include it in the index.js file

The condition of my todo-list react app now is 👍

The development of this app is in process.
